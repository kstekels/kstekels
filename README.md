# Hey, visitor, I'm Karlis! ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub coding warehouse, where I store my personal projects and some garbage code ðŸ˜…

- I have some experience with Python and Django, as well as Swift and Kotlin.

- You can check some of my sample projects:
  
  - [Mobile Shop](https://github.com/kstekels/MobileShop) - Written in Python and Django framework. It is simulating an e-Commerce web store, where you can buy smartphones and accessories. Design is made with bootstrap templates.
  
  - [Movies App](https://github.com/kstekels/MoviesTMDB) - The native Android app is written in Kotlin. This movies application is using TMDb API. Users can scroll, search and save movies to the local SQL database.
  
  - [Video Viewer](https://github.com/kstekels/Video-Viewer-App) - The native iOS app is written in Swift. This demo app is just a test project, how to play cached offline content in the app.

- I'm interested in mobile application development and right now I'm learning Kotlin to write better native Android apps ðŸ™‚
